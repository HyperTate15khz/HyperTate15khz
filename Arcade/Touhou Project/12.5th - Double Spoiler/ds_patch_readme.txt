Double Spoiler English Patch v1.00
------------------------------------

This patch is intended for use with Double Spoiler ~ Touhou Bunkachou v1.00a.

If installing on Windows Vista/7 with User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you must run the patch as administrator.
To run the patch as administrator, right click on ds_english_patch.exe and select "Run as administrator".

To run: 
1. Extract ds_english_patch.exe to a directory of your choice (DS install directory recommended)
2. Run ds_english_patch.exe
3. Provide the DS installation directory (where th125.exe and th125.dat are located) and hit "Patch"
4. After completion run th125e.exe for the patched version.  Use custom_e.exe to set runtime options.

Known issues:
* If bestshot files are reused from an unpatched version of DS, the spellcard titles for those bestshots will be displayed as mojibake until they are replaced with bestshots from the patched game.
* If your DS installation is located within a folder or path name that contains Japanese or other Unicode text (such as ダブルスポイラー) , the patch can fail to finish, or even fail to launch if the patch is run from within that directory.  Rename the directory to something non-Unicode and rerun the patch.
* When running the patched game under Linux using Wine, the Music Room text displays incorrectly.
